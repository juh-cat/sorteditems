# installation
### if you have git (make sure your Items folder is empty and backed up):

git bash:

`git clone https://github.com/juh-cat/sorteditems.git /c/Users/"$USERNAME"/Documents/Trackmania/Items`

powershell:

`git clone https://github.com/juh-cat/sorteditems.git "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\Trackmania\Items"`

if you don't have git, download the zip file by clicking the green Code button. after that, extract everything straight into your items folder, without making a parent directory, otherwise windows might throw some stupid errors. Use 7zip if you want to have a parent directory

git bash:

`git pull`

powershell:

`cd "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\Trackmania\Items"`
