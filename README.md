# sorteditems
new item set, losely based on the ski's set

# installation
if you have git (make sure your Items folder is empty and backed up):

`git clone https://github.com/juh-cat/sorteditems.git /c/Users/"$USERNAME"/Documents/Trackmania/Items`

if you don't have git, download the zip file by clicking the green Code button. after that, extract everything straight into your items folder, without making a parent directory, otherwise windows might throw some stupid errors. Use 7zip if you want to have a parent directory
